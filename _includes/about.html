                <h2>About GRE</h2>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/gre4index/GRE">GRE</a> is a benchmark suite for learned indexes and traditional indexes to measure throughput and latency with custom workload (read / write ratio) and any dataset. GRE quantifies datasets using local and global hardness, and includes a synthetic data generator to generate data with various hardness.</p>
                <p>The GRE benchmark is brought to you by <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/eric-chi-lik-lo/">Eric Lo</a> and <a href="https://pohchaichon.github.io/">Chaichon Wongkham</a>, from CUHK</p>
                <p>This method is aimed at providing a comprehensive and fair benchmarking toward different Learned Index in different database environment</p>
                <p>The index developers can detect their products' performance and reliability in varied database difficulty</p>
